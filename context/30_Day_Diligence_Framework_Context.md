# Context Capsule — 30-Day Due Diligence Framework

## Artifact Name
30-Day Due Diligence Framework (PE / Corporate Development)

## Artifact Type
Process framework / decision system

## Intended Use
This artifact is intended to demonstrate **how I structure diligence under real-world constraints**, not how I execute a single deal.

It represents:
- How I prioritize unknowns
- How I sequence risk discovery
- How I convert incomplete information into a defensible IC decision

This framework is written as if it were to be used **inside a PE or corporate development team**, under time pressure and accountability.

---

## Primary Objective

The objective of this framework is **not completeness**.

The objective is to:
- Identify **fatal flaws early**
- Distinguish **structural risk vs execution risk**
- Decide **where deeper diligence is justified**
- Decide **when to stop**

The framework is optimized for **decision survivability**, not analytical elegance.

---

## Information Boundary

This framework assumes:
- Imperfect information
- Limited time (30 days)
- Partial access to management and data
- Asymmetric downside relative to upside

It does **not** assume:
- Full data rooms
- Perfect disclosure
- Stable timelines
- Cooperative outcomes

Missing information is treated as **analytically meaningful**, not as an inconvenience.

---

## Evaluation Lens

This artifact should be evaluated on whether it:

- Surfaces the **right risks early**
- Forces explicit trade-offs
- Prevents false confidence
- Encourages disciplined walk-away decisions

It should **not** be evaluated on:
- Depth of financial modeling
- Exhaustiveness of workstreams
- Technical granularity of accounting or valuation

---

## Design Philosophy

The framework is intentionally:
- **Downside-first**
- **Judgment-driven**
- **Model-light**
- **Decision-oriented**

Models are intentionally excluded at early stages to avoid:
- False precision
- Premature anchoring
- Distraction from execution and structural risk

Financial modeling is assumed to occur **after** kill-risk elimination, not before.

---

## Phase Logic

The four phases are sequenced intentionally:

1. **Kill-Risk Identification (Days 1–7)**  
   Eliminate deals that fail under basic scrutiny.

2. **Economic Reality Check (Days 8–15)**  
   Understand cash engines without relying on forecasts.

3. **Execution Stress Test (Days 16–23)**  
   Pressure-test real-world friction and timing risk.

4. **IC Readiness (Days 24–30)**  
   Convert uncertainty into a decision with explicit conditions.

Each phase exists to answer a **single dominant question**.  
If that question is not answered, the process has failed.

---

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

This framework is designed to:
- Precede IC memos
- Govern diligence sequencing
- Explain *why* certain analyses exist and others do not

It pairs intentionally with:
- PE-style IC memos
- Kill-risk memoranda
- Downside and capital protection analyses

---

## Common Misinterpretations (Preemptive)

This framework should **not** be interpreted as:
- A consulting engagement plan
- A post-dataroom diligence checklist
- A valuation or modeling roadmap

Its purpose is **decision framing**, not execution tracking.

---

## Accountability Standard

This framework is written under the assumption that:
- Decisions will be challenged
- Outcomes will be reviewed ex-post
- Accountability is real

Every phase is designed to leave an **audit trail of judgment**, not just analysis.

---

## Why This Artifact Exists Publicly

This artifact exists to demonstrate:
- How I think before models
- How I structure uncertainty
- How I protect capital when information is incomplete

It is intended as a **proof-of-work substitute** for live diligence exposure.

---

## How to Review This Artifact

To evaluate this framework properly:
1. Read it as if capital is at risk
2. Ask whether it would prevent avoidable losses
3. Ask whether it forces earlier, better decisions

If it does, it has done its job.
