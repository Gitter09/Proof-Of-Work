2. Objective of This Artifact

The objective of this artifact is to:
	•	Demonstrate IC-grade investment judgment under public-information constraints
	•	Evaluate GE Aerospace as a standalone asset post-spin using a PE-style risk lens
	•	Signal readiness for PE / Corp Dev roles through disciplined downside framing
	•	Show restraint where disclosure is incomplete rather than fabricate precision

Success is defined as a senior reviewer concluding:

“This reflects how a real IC discussion would be framed pre-diligence.”

⸻

3. Intended Audience
	•	Primary audience:
	•	Private Equity partners
	•	Corporate Development leads
	•	Secondary audience:
	•	Senior recruiters evaluating analyst / associate readiness

Evaluation standard assumed:
	•	Decision quality
	•	Risk awareness
	•	Capital protection discipline
	•	Disclosure literacy

This artifact is not optimized for academic grading or junior analyst impressiveness.

⸻

4. Artifact Classification (Critical)

This artifact represents:
	•	☑ Pre-diligence, public-information analysis

This artifact is not:
	•	☐ A full underwriting model
	•	☐ A definitive valuation
	•	☐ A post-dataroom IC memo
	•	☐ A management-backed forecast

The memo should be interpreted as an early IC framing, not a final investment decision.

⸻

5. Information Boundary

Permitted sources:
	•	SEC filings (Form 10, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
	•	Management disclosures
	•	Investor Day materials
	•	Executed but publicly filed intercompany agreements

Explicitly excluded:
	•	Analyst estimates or consensus models
	•	Sell-side or buy-side projections
	•	Assumed or proxy economics
	•	Non-public schedules or redacted exhibits

If information is missing:
	•	It is explicitly stated as not publicly disclosed
	•	It is treated as an execution or diligence risk
	•	It is not filled via inference

⸻

6. Assumptions

This artifact operates under a zero-assumption rule.

No forward projections, normalizations, or inferred economics are permitted unless explicitly disclosed by management in public filings.

⸻

7. Explicit Non-Assumptions

The following are explicitly not assumed, even if commonly modeled in practice:
	•	TSA pricing, duration, margins, or exit timelines
	•	Separation cost phasing beyond historically disclosed amounts
	•	Total remaining separation cost envelope
	•	Pension asset/liability quantum or funding schedules
	•	Synergy realization or cost takeout
	•	Normalized or steady-state margins
	•	Management execution quality beyond stated disclosures

These items are treated as open diligence questions.

⸻

8. Evaluation Lens

This artifact must be read through a:
	•	Risk-first
	•	Capital preservation
	•	Survivability-under-execution-stress

lens.

Upside optimization, IRR maximization, and multiple expansion are explicitly secondary to downside protection and liquidity sufficiency.

⸻

9. Decision Philosophy Applied

The memo applies a PE-style decision framework characterized by:
	•	Identification of failure conditions rather than base-case optimization
	•	Use of qualitative risk framing where quantification would imply false precision
	•	Emphasis on liquidity, flexibility, and absence of forced actions
	•	Approval with conditions rather than binary go/no-go conclusions

Uncertainty is acknowledged rather than obscured.

⸻

10. Known Gaps (Intentional)

The following gaps are intentional and acceptable at this stage:
	•	Absence of TSA service-by-service economics and cash costs
	•	Lack of consolidated forward separation cost estimates
	•	No quantitative pension funding schedule specific to GE Aerospace
	•	No disclosure of standalone SG&A normalization

These gaps would be addressed through confirmatory diligence, not pre-IC modeling.

⸻

11. What Would Change the Conclusions

The conclusions or approval conditions in this memo would materially change if public or diligenced information revealed:
	•	TSA costs materially impairing liquidity or cash flow durability
	•	Separation costs significantly exceeding historical disclosed ranges
	•	Pension obligations requiring outsized near-term cash funding
	•	Emergence of restrictive covenants or near-term maturity pressure
	•	Structural erosion of service margins or backlog quality

Absent these findings, the core thesis remains intact.

⸻

12. Constraints on Revision

Any future revision must:
	•	Preserve the zero-assumption rule unless explicitly overridden
	•	Declare new assumptions clearly at the top of the memo
	•	Increment the artifact version number
	•	Avoid retroactively normalizing or modeling undisclosed economics

No silent reinterpretation is permitted.

⸻

13. Authorial Intent

This artifact is intended to signal judgment, restraint, and IC readiness, not modeling sophistication or forecasting accuracy.

It should not be interpreted as:
	•	A claim of proprietary insight
	•	A substitute for full diligence
	•	An attempt to predict outcomes with precision
