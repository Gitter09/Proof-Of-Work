# 30-Day Due Diligence Framework  
### PE / Corporate Development – Risk-First Underwriting

This document outlines a **30-day diligence framework** designed to mirror how private equity and corporate development teams de-risk investment decisions under time and information constraints.

The objective is **not completeness**.  
The objective is **decision survivability**.

---

## Core Principle

> **Diligence exists to collapse uncertainty fast, not to learn everything.**

A successful 30-day process:
- Identifies **fatal flaws early**
- Distinguishes **execution risk from structural risk**
- Converts incomplete information into a **defensible IC decision**

---

## What This Framework Is (and Is Not)

### This Framework Is:
- A **risk discovery engine**
- A **sequenced prioritization of unknowns**
- A tool to decide **where deeper diligence is justified**

### This Framework Is Not:
- A checklist
- A valuation exercise
- A forecasting model
- A consultant-style workplan

---

## Diligence Pillars

All work maps to four non-negotiable pillars:

1. **Business Durability**
2. **Cash & Capital Risk**
3. **Execution & Separation Risk**
4. **Downside & Failure Modes**

Anything that does not map to these pillars is secondary.

## 30-Day Structure (Partner View)

| Phase | Days | Objective |
|-----|------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 1–7 | Kill-risk identification |
| Phase 2 | 8–15 | Economic reality check |
| Phase 3 | 16–23 | Execution stress test |
| Phase 4 | 24–30 | IC readiness & decision framing |

---

## Phase 1 (Days 1–7): Kill-Risk Identification

### Objective
Answer the question:  
**“Should we stop looking at this?”**

### Key Questions
- Is the core business **structurally viable**?
- Are there **dependencies we cannot control**?
- Is there **embedded leverage** (operational, contractual, regulatory)?

### Focus Areas
- Revenue concentration
- Customer power and switching costs
- Contract enforceability
- Regulatory constraints
- Structural separation risks (TSAs, stranded costs)

### Output
**Kill-Risk Memo (2–3 pages)**  
Explicitly states:
- Conditions under which the deal is **non-investable**
- Risks that cannot be mitigated through pricing or structure

If a kill-risk memo does not exist by Day 7, diligence is already failing.

---

## Phase 2 (Days 8–15): Economic Reality Check

### Objective
Understand **how the business actually generates cash**, without relying on forecasted upside.

### Key Questions
- What are the **true cash engines**?
- Which costs are **structurally fixed vs optically variable**?
- Where does margin **actually come from**?

### Focus Areas
- Revenue quality (recurring vs episodic)
- Cost structure rigidity
- Working capital behavior
- Maintenance vs growth capex
- Cash conversion dynamics

### Output
**Economic Bridge**
- Revenue → EBITDA → Cash → Capital
- No projections, only **drivers and sensitivities**

---

## Phase 3 (Days 16–23): Execution Stress Test

### Objective
Pressure-test the deal against **real-world friction**, not base-case assumptions.

### Key Questions
- What must go right **simultaneously**?
- Where does timing risk compound?
- What costs scale faster than expected?

### Focus Areas
- TSA unwind feasibility
- Systems and process migration
- Talent retention and incentives
- Governance latency
- Cost duplication windows

### Output
**Execution Risk Map**
- Risk × Probability × Impact
- Identification of **non-linear failure points**

This phase is where most deals quietly die.

---

## Phase 4 (Days 24–30): IC Readiness

### Objective
Convert uncertainty into a **clear decision**, not a report.

### Key Questions
- What are we underwriting?
- What are we explicitly **not** underwriting?
- What reverses this decision?

### Focus Areas
- Downside protection
- Liquidity sufficiency
- Covenant and capital structure resilience
- Exit optionality (even if theoretical)

### Output
**Investment Committee Memo**
- Clear recommendation
- Explicit conditions
- Defined walk-away triggers

---

## Decision Orientation

A 30-day diligence process is successful only if it produces:
- A decision the IC can defend
- A downside the IC understands
- Conditions the IC can enforce

Uncertainty is acceptable.  
Unacknowledged uncertainty is not.

---

## Why This Framework Exists

Most capital losses do not come from:
- Incorrect models
- Bad forecasts
- Market timing

They come from:
- Ignored execution risk
- Underestimated downside
- Overconfidence in incomplete information

This framework is designed to prevent that.

---

## Intended Use

This framework is applicable to:
- PE buyouts
- Carve-outs
- Corporate development acquisitions
- Control and minority investments

It is sector-agnostic and repeatable.
