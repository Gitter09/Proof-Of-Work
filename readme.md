# Proof of Work – PE / Corporate Development

This repository contains investment committee–style work products designed to demonstrate PE-grade judgment, diligence structure, and downside-focused underwriting.

The work emphasizes **decision-making under uncertainty**, not model-driven precision.

---

## What This Is

- A **PE-style carve-out IC memo** written as if for an internal investment committee
- Grounded strictly in **publicly disclosed information**
- Explicit about **what is known, what is not disclosed, and why that matters**
- Focused on **capital protection, execution risk, and downside resilience**

This is not a valuation exercise.
This is a judgment exercise.

- **artifacts/**  
  Final deliverables intended to reflect IC-grade communication.

- **charter/**  
  Project-level constraints defining scope, methodology, and non-assumptions.

- **context/**  
  Explicit context capsules that explain intent, boundaries, and evaluation lens.  
  These are designed to prevent hindsight bias or misinterpretation.

## Methodology & Constraints

- Analysis is **strictly limited to public disclosures** (SEC filings, investor materials, separation agreements).
- Where key economics (e.g., TSA pricing, separation cost phasing, pension magnitude) are **not publicly disclosed**, they are treated as **execution risk**, not modeled inputs.
- No inferred, proxy, or “expected” numbers are used.
- No reliance on multiple expansion, growth acceleration, or forecasted synergies.

The absence of information is treated as **analytically meaningful**.

## Intended Audience

This work is intended for:
- Private equity
- Corporate development
- Strategy
- Investment / transaction-focused roles

It is written for readers who evaluate:
- Risk before return
- Execution before upside
- Capital protection before optimization

---

## Why This Exists

This repository is meant to substitute for:
- Deal team reps
- Live diligence exposure
- IC room experience

It reflects how I think about real decisions when information is incomplete and accountability is high.
