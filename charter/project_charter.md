PROJECT CHARTER v1.0

Proof-of-Work Track for PE / Corp Dev Readiness

⸻

1. Metadata
	•	Author: Harshit Singh
	•	Charter Version: v1.0
	•	Created: 2026-01-06
	•	Status: Active
	•	Primary Use: Persistent context reference for AI-assisted work
	•	Storage: GitHub (source of truth)

⸻

2. Objective

The objective of this project is to systematically replace missing credentials (MBA, CFA, full-time PE/IB experience) with institutional-grade proof of work that demonstrates:
	•	Investment judgment
	•	Risk awareness
	•	Structured thinking
	•	Decision-making under uncertainty

The output must be credible to:
	•	Private Equity professionals
	•	Corporate Development teams
	•	Senior finance operators
	•	Recruiters screening for analyst / associate readiness

This is not a learning exercise.
This is a signaling and evaluation exercise.

⸻

3. Target Roles

Primary targets:
	•	Private Equity Analyst / Associate (pre-MBA)
	•	Corporate Development Analyst / Associate
	•	Strategy / Investment roles with IC exposure

Secondary (acceptable but not preferred):
	•	Founder’s Office (investment-heavy)
	•	Strategy roles with direct senior exposure

Explicitly not targeting:
	•	Pure operational roles
	•	Pure data science roles
	•	Roles without decision or risk exposure

⸻

4. Evaluation Lens

All work must be evaluated as if reviewed by:
	•	A PE Investment Committee member, or
	•	A Corp Dev lead presenting to CFO / CEO

The standard is:

“Would this reduce my diligence risk or decision risk?”

Not:

“Is this impressive for a student?”

⸻

5. Artifact Philosophy

Artifacts must:
	•	Replace credentials, not decorate a resume
	•	Demonstrate how decisions are made, not just outcomes
	•	Emphasize downside, constraints, and failure modes

Preference order:
	1.	Judgment and risk framing
	2.	Clarity of thought
	3.	Accuracy to disclosed facts
	4.	Restraint over false precision

⸻

6. Explicit Constraints

The following constraints are non-negotiable:
	•	No invented data
	•	No inferred economics unless explicitly stated as inference
	•	No modeling where inputs are not fully disclosed
	•	No “expected” or “assumed” numbers presented as facts
	•	No frameworks for show (Porter, SWOT, etc. unless genuinely useful)

If information is not publicly available:
	•	It must be stated explicitly
	•	It must be treated as a diligence gap, not filled in

⸻

7. Explicit Non-Assumptions

The following are explicitly not assumed unless publicly disclosed:
	•	TSA pricing, duration, or margin
	•	Separation cost phasing beyond historical disclosures
	•	Pension funding schedules or actuarial impacts
	•	Synergy realization
	•	Management execution quality beyond stated disclosures
	•	Normalized margins or steady-state cash flows

Any future work that violates this must flag the violation clearly.

⸻

8. Zero-Assumption Rule

Unless explicitly overridden in a specific artifact:
	•	All analysis must be grounded in:
	•	SEC filings
	•	Management disclosures
	•	Investor day materials
	•	Clearly cited public documents

Forecasting, normalization, or stress testing is allowed only when:
	•	Inputs are explicitly disclosed, or
	•	The exercise is explicitly labeled as hypothetical

⸻

9. Artifact Classification System

Each artifact must declare its class at the top:
	•	Public-Info IC Memo
	•	Hypothetical Underwriting Case
	•	Diligence Planning Document
	•	Risk Framework Note
	•	Valuation Illustration (Assumption-Driven)

This prevents misinterpretation of intent.

⸻

10. Decision Philosophy

The project follows a PE-style decision philosophy:
	•	Focus on capital preservation first
	•	Understand how deals fail, not just how they work
	•	Accept uncertainty when unavoidable
	•	Do not hide uncertainty behind spreadsheets

Words are preferred over numbers when precision is false.

⸻

11. Known Gaps (Intentional)

The following gaps are intentional and acceptable:
	•	Lack of proprietary management access
	•	Lack of non-public TSA schedules
	•	Lack of internal cost allocation data
	•	Lack of forward-looking guidance beyond disclosures

These gaps are treated as:

“Would require confirmatory diligence”

—not as analytical failures.

⸻

12. What Would Change Conclusions

Each major artifact should explicitly state:
	•	What missing information could change the recommendation
	•	Whether it would change:
	•	Risk assessment
	•	Capital structure comfort
	•	Approval conditions
	•	Go / No-Go decision

This signals judgment maturity.

⸻

13. Reusability Rule

This charter applies unless:
	•	A newer version explicitly supersedes it, or
	•	An artifact declares deviations upfront

Any AI or collaborator must be provided this charter before modifying or extending prior work.

⸻

14. Success Criteria

This project is successful if:
	•	A professional reviewer says:
“This reads like someone who understands how decisions are actually made.”
	•	The work invites:
	•	Serious critique
	•	Clarifying questions
	•	Follow-up conversations

—not dismissal.

⸻

15. Version Control
	•	This document is Project Charter v1.0
	•	All updates must:
	•	Increment version number
	•	Log changes clearly
	•	Preserve prior versions
